Hello Ryan,

In my turing machine code, I appended Z at the end of each input string, but not at the beginning. When I appended Z at the beginning of the input string, the output was the same but with the original input symbol instead of x. When I ran the binaryDecrement.txt file on my machine, it would only work properly if there is a Z appended to the beginning of each input string (whether through the text file or the code).

I would appreciate your comments and feedback about this when you return the assignment.

Also, to test my inputs and outputs I had a string value as the input and output path. I'm unsure how to code it so that you can run it from the terminal as mentioned in the instructions. To test different turing machines, please change the input and output in the code to match what is needed.

Best,
David
